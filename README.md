### Testing
1. Code Validation
    - [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fdimitris112.github.io%2Ftravel-agency-1st-official-project%2F) & [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdimitris112.github.io%2Ftravel-agency-1st-official-project%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) validation are both errorless.

2. Test cases
- For all metrics I used **Lighthouse** on incognito Chrome to avoid any plugins/extensions interference.
 - The **index** page passes with three 100 score and only the **Accessibility** on a 90 score. Almost the same goes for the **signup** page too but this time it's full of 100.
